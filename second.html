    <h3>Heyyy!!</h3>

    <p class="second-p">You made it! I’m so proud of you! As I write this, there is a huge grin on my face. There’s always huge grin on my face every time I think about you (which is almost all the time). I wanted to do something cute for the first month milestone. It’s
        kind of a big deal for me considering I tend to screw things up even before the first month is up. I’m proud of myself for not screwing this up with you! I think it’s because you feel right, and this feels right. And subconsciously, my brain and
        heart knew exactly what to do.</p>

    <p class="second-p">What’s ironic is I did not know what to do for you today. I’m not usually the type to celebrate monthly “anniversaries”. But you’re different and everything about you is different. I had a lot of ideas, most of which required me to be physically present
        with you. But this one stuck with me. It’s not a lot, but I had fun coming up with it, and executing it. And I hope this puts a smile on your already cute face, making it cuter!</p>

    <p class="second-p" , style="font-size: 12px;">P.s. I’m proud of myself for not telling you about this before today!</p>

    <p class="second-p" , style="font-size: 12px;">P.p.s. Nah, not anymore.</p>
